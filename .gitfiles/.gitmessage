# Type should be one of the following:
# * feat (new feature)
# * fix (bug fix)
# * docs (changes to documentation)
# * style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
# * refactor (refactoring production code)
# * test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
# * chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
# Scope is just the scope of the change. Something like (admin) or (teacher).
# Subject should use impertivite tone and say what you did.
#
# The body should go into detail about changes made.
#
# The footer should contain any JIRA (or other tool) issue references or
# actions.
# References #1, #4, and #2.
# Fixes #1.
# The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is 
# also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**. 
# Breaking Changes should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space #
# or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
